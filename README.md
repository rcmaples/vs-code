# Setting up VS Code:

## Downloading VS Code:

Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download Studio.

## Configuring VS Code:

### Portable Mode
I use VS Code's [Portable Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable) which allows me to store all of my editor settings in an easy to find place. All I have to do is drop a folder named `code-portable-data` in the same directory as the `Visual Studio Code.app` file. The instructions from Microsoft are fairly straightforward.

### Custom Snippets
I created several custom snippets to increase my efficiency. These can be found at:

- [html snippets](./config/snippets/html.json)
- [javascript snippets](./config/snippets/javascript.json)

There aren't any overly useful snippets for our current goals, but these should provide an example of how you can create custom snippets that enhance your own workflow.

### Custom Config
My custom config settings are available [as well](./config/settings.json). This details any "user" settings I've modified in VS Code such as colors, fonts, rules for _TODO Parser_ and several others. Feel free to use this as a reference on things that might be useful to you. 

## Productivity Extensions ðŸ¤“

VS Code is highly extensible and there are many extensions available to perform various enhancements to your workflow. There are many that do the same function. Please research the plugins you choose and determine which will work best for you and the way you work.

I just want to share my current setup with anyone who is interested.

### _Prettier_ by Esben Petersen

- Name: Prettier - Code formatter
- Description: VS Code plugin for prettier/prettier
- VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- This extension formats your code after you write it to fall into line with opinionated rules.

  Generally in my own environment I try to follow the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript); but some devs prefer a different style. This helps inforce those style guides automagically after being configured. Out of the box it's pretty decent though as well.

### _React snippets_ by Equimper

- Name: React-Native/React/Redux snippets for es6/es7
- Description: Code snippets for React-Native/React/Redux es6/es7 and flowtype/typescript, Storybook
- VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EQuimper.react-native-react-redux
- VS Code allows for code snippets that auto expand into full lines. For instance, using react snippets, one can type `imrc` will populate that line with `import React, { Component } from 'React'`. There are other snippets available, but this is probably one of my most used.
- No demo gif here, but a complete list of snippets can be found on this plugin's [READEME](https://github.com/EQuimper/VSC-React-Native-React-Redux-Snippets/blob/master/README.md).
